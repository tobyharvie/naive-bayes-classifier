# naive-bayes-classifier

This is Python code produced during an academic assignment. The goal was to build a Naive Bayes model for the use of text classification, without the use of existing ML libraries. After satisfying the base task, I challenged myself to extend the model by implementing improvements, again without using ML libraries. I took the base model from achieving approximately 90% accuracy on both the training and testing datasets to approximately 98%. Improvements include implementing Laplace smoothing, ngrams, and feature selection using Chi-squared correlation analysis. 

The [HTML report](/naive-bayes-classifier-report.html) included in this repository was submitted academically and is an excellent summary of my evaluation of the model along with explanation of improvements. Also refer to the [raw Python code](/naive-bayes-model.py).
